    "In this assignment we will work on a task of \"query-focused summarisation\" on medical questions where the goal is, given a medical question and a list of sentences extracted from relevant medical publications, to determine which of these sentences from the list can be used as part of the answer to the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use data that has been derived from the **BioASQ challenge** (http://www.bioasq.org/), after some data manipulation to make it easier to process for this assignment. The BioASQ challenge organises several \"shared tasks\", including a task on biomedical semantic question answering which we are using here. The data are in the file `bioasq10_labelled.csv`, which is part of the zip file provided. Each row of the file has a question, a sentence text, and a label that indicates whether the sentence text is part of the answer to the question (1) or not (0).\n",
